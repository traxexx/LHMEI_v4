Implement:
  Read directly from coord sort bam
  Output discovery vcf

Steps: (if not specified, will do all steps sequentially)
  GetControlStat   skipped if --NoContrl is set. Thus likelihood is very similar to Tangram
  ProcessProper: print disc reads out
    sort disc bam
  ProcessDiscReads
  GetLikelihood

  Genotype   need to run separately with given bam & discovery vcf list


Required input (discovery):
  -Bam		Bam files for LHMEI discovery
* -Mapper	Mapper for generate bam files. Default BWA.
^ -MEfasta	Consensus sequence (Alu + LINE + SVA)
* -MaskBed	Regions that do not calculate MEI (if not exist, calculate all regions)
* -MEcoord	Genomic coordinate of MEs. To speed up. (if not exist, need to SW remap disc reads)
^ -GenomeFasta	Reference genome sequence (default hs37d5)
  -WordDir	Working directory
^ -HetIndex	Control stats of sliced MEI (generated by SetReference, default in LHMEI/refs)


Default HetIndex:
   250 Alu
   200 L1
   100 SVA
